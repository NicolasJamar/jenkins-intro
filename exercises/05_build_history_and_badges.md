# ðŸ§ª Exercise 5: Build History and Badges

**Goal:** Explore Jenkins' job history and embeddable build status.

## Steps:
1. Run your `simple-pipeline` job several times (some with minor errors).
2. View the **Build History** panel and explore job icons.
3. Locate the **Build Badge URL** on the job's main page.

## Reflection:
- What do the icons/colors mean?
- How would you use this in a team dashboard?
